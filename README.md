# -CIFAR-10_Image_classification_CNN

Introduction:

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my CNN image classifier developed using the CIFAR-10 dataset. In today's digital age, the ability to analyze and classify images is becoming increasingly important across various domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and security systems. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful deep learning technique for image classification tasks.

Motivation:

The motivation behind developing this CNN image classifier lies in the growing demand for accurate and efficient image recognition systems. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision by leveraging their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from images. This makes CNNs well-suited for tasks such as object recognition, scene understanding, and image classification. By building and showcasing my CNN image classifier, I aim to demonstrate my skills and expertise in the field of deep learning and computer vision.

State-of-the-Art:

The field of image classification has witnessed significant advancements in recent years. State-of-the-art models, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, have achieved remarkable accuracy and have become benchmarks for image classification tasks. These models utilize deep architectures with advanced techniques like residual connections, densely connected layers, and efficient network architectures to achieve unprecedented performance on large-scale image datasets.

My Approach:

In this project, I designed, trained, and evaluated the accuracy of three different CNN models that I developed from scratch. I carefully selected and implemented various layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, to create robust and effective models. I trained these models using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images belonging to ten different classes.

Evaluation Results:

I thoroughly evaluated the performance of my custom CNN models by measuring their accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test dataset. The evaluation process involved feeding the test images through the trained models and comparing the predicted labels with the ground truth labels. I meticulously analyzed the accuracy and loss metrics to gauge the effectiveness of each model and made necessary adjustments to improve their performance.

AlexNet Implementation:

To further expand my exploration of image classification, I also implemented the renowned AlexNet model. AlexNet, introduced in 2012, played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the field of computer vision. I adapted the original AlexNet architecture to the CIFAR-10 dataset and trained it using the same evaluation process. By including the implementation and evaluation of AlexNet in this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to work with state-of-the-art models and adapt them to specific classification tasks.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, throughout this project, I have designed and trained multiple CNN models for image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset. While the achieved accuracy of around 75% may not be comparable to the state-of-the-art performance, I am satisfied with the progress made and the experience gained in all the steps of designing, training, and evaluating CNN models.

Working on this project has provided me with valuable insights into the intricacies of CNN architecture, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It has also highlighted the importance of hyperparameter tuning and experimentation to improve model performance.

Although the current results may not be groundbreaking, I am motivated to continue exploring and developing more advanced CNN models in the future. I believe that with further research, fine-tuning, and potentially incorporating state-of-the-art techniques, I can achieve higher accuracy and tackle more complex image classification tasks.

This colab notebook represents a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing my ability to work with CNNs and demonstrating my dedication to learning and improving in the field of deep learning. I am excited to continue my exploration of CNNs and pursue further advancements in the domain.

Good luck to anyone reviewing this notebook, and thank you for the opportunity to showcase my work!
