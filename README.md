# -CIFAR-10_Image_classification_CNN

Introduction:

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my CNN image classifier developed using the CIFAR-10 dataset. In today's digital age, the ability to analyze and classify images is becoming increasingly important across various domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and security systems. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful deep learning technique for image classification tasks.

Motivation:

The motivation behind developing this CNN image classifier lies in the growing demand for accurate and efficient image recognition systems. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision by leveraging their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from images. This makes CNNs well-suited for tasks such as object recognition, scene understanding, and image classification. By building and showcasing my CNN image classifier, I aim to demonstrate my skills and expertise in the field of deep learning and computer vision.

State-of-the-Art:

The field of image classification has witnessed significant advancements in recent years. State-of-the-art models, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, have achieved remarkable accuracy and have become benchmarks for image classification tasks. These models utilize deep architectures with advanced techniques like residual connections, densely connected layers, and efficient network architectures to achieve unprecedented performance on large-scale image datasets.

My Approach:

In this project, I designed, trained, and evaluated the accuracy of three different CNN models that I developed from scratch. I carefully selected and implemented various layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, to create robust and effective models. I trained these models using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images belonging to ten different classes.

Evaluation Results:

I thoroughly evaluated the performance of my custom CNN models by measuring their accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test dataset. The evaluation process involved feeding the test images through the trained models and comparing the predicted labels with the ground truth labels. I meticulously analyzed the accuracy and loss metrics to gauge the effectiveness of each model and made necessary adjustments to improve their performance.

AlexNet Implementation:

To further expand my exploration of image classification, I also implemented the renowned AlexNet model. AlexNet, introduced in 2012, played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the field of computer vision. I adapted the original AlexNet architecture to the CIFAR-10 dataset and trained it using the same evaluation process. By including the implementation and evaluation of AlexNet in this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to work with state-of-the-art models and adapt them to specific classification tasks.

Conclusion:

Through this GitHub repository, I showcase my expertise in CNN-based image classification by presenting the design, training, and evaluation of custom models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, I highlight my proficiency in implementing a renowned model like AlexNet. I believe this project demonstrates my passion for deep learning, computer vision, and my ability to tackle challenging classification tasks.
